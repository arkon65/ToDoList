# ToDoList
A simple android To-Do List app, written in Android studio and utilizing Google Firebase

In order to run this code, just import the whole thing in the Android Studio Projects path

This app is a very simple To-Do List, which takes a user text input and adds it in a Firebase database. 
From there, it shows the user what he has entered, using his phones unique IMEI code.

The only problem this app has is that I never got to make the "delete" fuction, in Firebase, work, which was very peculiar.
